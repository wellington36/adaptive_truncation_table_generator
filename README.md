# Adaptive Truncation Table Generator

- `comp_Z_iterations.py`, has dependency:
  - `utils/utils.py`: function `logdiffexp`;
  - `src/bounding_pairs_mp.py`: The Bounding pairs approach with mpmath structure;
  - `src/sequential_mp.py`: The Sequential approach with brute force and mpmath structure;
  - `src/brute_mp.py`: The Brute force approach with mpmath structure
  - `stan/comp_Z_brms_fixed.stan`: The COM-Poisson normalising constant by brms with index error corrected and M increased from _10^4_ to _10^6_;

Run (check if auxiliary libraries are installed):
```bash
python comp_Z_iterations.py
```
